# ðŸ‘‹ Hello developer!

This template leverages the free weather API available at [www.open-meteo.com](https://open-meteo.com) to showcase a weather dashboard featuring current weather conditions of diverse locations around the globe. Each location has a card that dynamically generates based on the current weather, displaying an image that represents the weather type, the temperature in degrees, and the wind conditions. The cards are arranged in a neat grid layout, achieved by using the display flex and wrap CSS properties.

The project serves as an example of what can be achieved. It is not a fully functional product. Feel free to use the source code and ideas as a starting point for your own projects.

## ðŸŽ¨ Where to find everything?

This template is made by using several technologies.  
Below are explanations about where to find specific code.

Public resources like images and icons are found in the folder `public`.

Data is stored in your admin console.

### Root HTML

HTML files are stored in a folder called `views`. Files have `.vue` extension.
In the `client/index.html` you can add your external links and scripts, or change other general code that is relevant on every page like the head.
You can find other templates in `views/`.

### CSS and images

You can find the main CSS file in `client/src/assets/main.css`. Images can also be stored here, but you are free to set up your own file structure for assets. 

### Application

You can find the core frontend Vue application in `client`, with a folder for public resources, `src/`, and the main `index.html`.

## ðŸ”¨ Please note
For now files created/uploaded or edited from within the terminal view will not be backed up or synced.
